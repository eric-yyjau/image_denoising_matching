# ECE251C project: image_denoising_matching
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VCM1yOlSXhzatvEgNLB1IoWqT81NWjPtbGr0THJ5uqE/edit#heading=h.nrpj9v3j7ji7

## To do
- Study and implement the bilateral filter, multiresolution bilateral filter, guided filter, DnCNN and DUDnCNN.
- Compare the image denoising and edge-preserving performance of the above algorithms, by peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR) and structural similarity (SSIM) index. (COCO dataset)
- Further compare the feature preserving performance by comparing the feature detection and matching result before and after denoising using SIFT. The metric is repeatability and homography estimation on COCO dataset. (or Hpatches[9] benchmark dataset)
